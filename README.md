CardMarket Price Tracker (Unmaintained)
This project was developed to track the prices of trading cards listed on CardMarket using their official API. However, due to changes in CardMarket's policies, the API is no longer accessible. As a result, this project is now unmaintained and will not function as intended.

Features (when functional)
Automated Price Tracking: Regularly fetched current market prices for your listed cards directly from CardMarket.
Customizable Alerts: Set price thresholds to receive notifications when card values change significantly.
Data Export: Export your price history data for analysis and record-keeping.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface to manage your tracked cards and settings.
Disclaimer
This project is no longer functional due to the removal of CardMarket's public API. The code is provided as-is for reference and educational purposes. It may contain outdated information and dependencies.
